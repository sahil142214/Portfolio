<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="screenshots/portfolio-dark.png" width=400 ></td>
    <td><img src="screenshots/portfolio-light.png" width=400 ></td>
  </tr>
 </table>


1. There is a basic console on homepage that looks like a terminal and functions on a handful number of commands. 
2. There are two themes of the site between which you can toggle by pressing the theme button on top right.
